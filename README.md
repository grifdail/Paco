Paco
====

This is **Paco**.

Paco is a Point and Click editor.

Paco allows anyone to make their own game, without technical knowledge.  
The aim of the project is to make a very simple tool, with a limited scope. Paco is not a powerful tool. It's a simple tool.
The project is currently at a beta level.

Paco stands for **Point and Click. Obviously**.

### Features

Right now, Paco allows you to :

+ Export to HTML (Easily publishable on platforms like Itchio )
+ Create simple scenes
+ use variables to add more dynamic behavior (think life bar, keys and locks, or basic inventory)

### Not featured

Paco is not for you if you want

 + Complexe logic
 + Animation (other than gifs)
 + Text adventure (Use the wonderful [twine](https://twinery.org/))
 + Action game (Well, I guess you could try, that would be interesting)
